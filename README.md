## Falcon PHP Framework
The Falcon PHP Framework is being developed by myself, Cryptogenic (Specter), as a recreational project for personal projects, however I decided to distribute it and make it open-sourced to allow others to learn from it or even use it if they wish. It is easy to modify to suit your project, and minimal. Unlike larger frameworks it doesn't pollute your app with a bunch of things you don't need, it's a base that you can build what you need on top of it, including a basic (but secure) registration and login system. More information on modification of the framework and the login system can be found in official documentation.

## Motivation
This project was derived from projects I have developed for production, however I believe it can be used by others to learn from or even for use.

## Latest Version
The latest version is currently version 1.0. Future updates may or may not be commited.

## Documentation
All documentation for Falcon Framework usage can be found in /docs. Furthermore, the framework contains file comments as well as line comments where necessary.
