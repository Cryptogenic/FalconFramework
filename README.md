## Falcon PHP Framework
The Falcon PHP Framework is being developed by myself, Cryptogenic (Specter), as a recreational project for personal projects, however I decided to distribute it and make it open-sourced to allow others to learn from it or even use it if they wish.

## Motivation
This project was derived from projects I have developed for production, however I believe it can be used by others to learn from or even for use.

## Latest Version
The latest version is currently in the alpha development phase, more information will be available in the mere future.

## Documentation
All documentation for Falcon Framework usage can be found in /docs.

## Contributors
Created by Specter (GitHub: Cryptogenic), with help from Tustin (github.com/Tustin).
